# Voyageurs
## A repo to play with

This repository is shared by the Codeup students in the Voyageurs cohort. Participants are encouraged to play and experiment. There will likely be collisions and conflicts, but we can have fun solving them together.


## voyageurDictionary.md
One resource that this will be used for is an ongoing list of vocabulary words that students can add to, both words and definitions. Go ahead and modify voyageurDictionary.md and submit any changes you wish.
